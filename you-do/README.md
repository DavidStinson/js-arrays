Let's practice creating, modifying, and iterating over an array!

1. Assign an empty array to a variable named `books`.
2. Add **'The Shining'** to the `books` array.
3. Add **'Moby Dick'** to the **front** of `books`.
4. `console.log()` the second element of `books`.
5. Update the second element by assigning to it **'Dune'**.
6. Insert **'Great Expectations'** as a new second element (between 'Moby Dick' & 'Dune').
7. Iterate over the entire `books` array and `console.log()` each book string.

I'll code a solution when we return.
