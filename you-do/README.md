# ðŸ’ª You Do - 10 minutes

Let's practice creating, modifying, and iterating over an array of strings!

1. Assign an empty array to a variable named `books`.
2. Add **'The Shining'** or another book of your choice to the `books` array.
3. Add **'Pride and Prejudice'** or another book of your chioce to the **front** of `books`.
4. `console.log()` the second element of `books`.
5. Update the second element by assigning to it **'Dune'** or another book of your choice.
6. Insert **'Great Expectations'** or another book of your choice as a new second element (between **'Pride and Prejudice'** and **'Dune'** if you followed the examples above).
7. Iterate over the entire `books` array and `console.log()` each book string.
